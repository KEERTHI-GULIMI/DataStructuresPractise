Given an array arr[] of positive integers where every element appears even times except for one. Find that number occurring an odd number of times.

approach is xor as we know xor of two same number is 0 so the odd number will remain.

class Solution {
    int getSingle(int arr[]) {
       int ans=0;
       for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
           ans=ans^arr[i];
       }
       
       return ans;
    }
}
