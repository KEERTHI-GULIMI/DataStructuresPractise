Question : is to find all the subsets of a given array..
Approches :1: Here we need to return the subsets of an array
2. This can be achieved by take or not take of an element
3. For every element we have two choices, either we take it or not take
4. So that we can generate all the subsets
5. Store all the subsets and return the answer
2)power set way 
1. let's take an example array, [1, 2, 3]
    - size of array, 3 so lets take three size binary number
    - 0 0 0 => [] no elements in the array
    - 0 0 1 => [3] 
    - 0 1 0 => [2]
    - 0 1 1 => [2, 3]
    - 1 0 0 => [1]
    - 1 0 1 => [1, 3]
    - 1 1 0 => [1, 2]
    - 1 1 1 => [1, 2, 3]

2. As we see above we have generated all the subsets with the help of power set.
3. The every set bit in a number will represent to consider that element.
